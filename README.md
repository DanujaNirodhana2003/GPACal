## Project Info
K.D.N. Chandrasena .

GPA CAL is a modern and user-friendly web application designed by students of the University of Peradeniya to calculate their semester GPA and cumulative GPA (CGPA). It allows users to add subjects with their name, credits, and grade, categorize them by semester, and instantly calculate both individual semester GPA and total CGPA. The app also supports light and dark themes and provides a clean, responsive, and fancy interface using shadcn-ui and Tailwind CSS.

This project was developed with the help of **AI-assisted coding** using **Lovable** and guidance from **ChatGPT**, which helped structure the code, create components, and set up the GPA calculation logic. Special credit goes to Lovable for providing the platform that made rapid prototyping and development possible.
